## Task1 
- `1_hidden_layer.ipynb` - contains the implementation from [chapter 11](https://github.com/rasbt/machine-learning-book/blob/main/ch11/ch11.ipynb) using single hidden layer
- `2_hidden_layers.ipynb` - contains our upgrade to the previous notebook, adding another linear layer
- `2_layers_torch.ipynb` - contains our implementation using PyTorch to fully connected net with 2 linear layers (for comparison)
- `model_torch_fc_2_layers.pt` - previous model's (PyTorch) state and weights after training (for ease of use)

## Task1 
- `task2.ipynb` - contains the implementation of the various nets we used (transfer learning)
- `models/` - the dir contains the models after retraining on the 102flowers dataset
